🐱 Scratch Project

This project is developed using Scratch, a visual programming platform designed for beginners.
It helps learners understand coding concepts in a simple and interactive way.

🎯 Project Overview

The project uses sprites to represent characters and objects.
It demonstrates how user actions control behavior through visual programming blocks.

✨ Features

🎮 Interactive sprites that respond to user input
🔁 Uses loops for smooth and repeated actions
🧠 Includes logic and conditional statements
📢 Broadcast messages for sprite communication
🎵 Sounds and visual effects for better engagement

🛠️ Tech Stack

Platform: Scratch

Programming Style: Block-based (No text coding required)

📚 How It Works

Sprites perform actions based on key presses and mouse clicks

Events trigger movements, animations, and interactions
